        Lasagne is a classic Italian dish consisting of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with rich meat or vegetable sauces, creamy béchamel sauce, and cheese, typically mozzarella and Parmesan. The assembled dish is baked until bubbly and golden brown, resulting in a flavorful, hearty meal.

      <h2> How to make a Lasagne</h2>
      <p>To make lasagne, start by preparing the meat sauce: brown ground beef or Italian sausage with chopped onion and minced garlic, then add tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. Season with salt, pepper, and fresh herbs like basil and parsley. Let it simmer. In a separate bowl, mix ricotta cheese with an egg and a bit of parsley. In a baking dish, layer cooked lasagne sheets with the meat sauce, ricotta mixture, and shredded mozzarella cheese, repeating the layers until the dish is full. Top with grated Parmesan cheese. Bake at 375°F (190°C) for about 45 minutes, until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown. Let it rest before serving.
